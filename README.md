# Image-Haze-Removal-using-Dark-Channel-Prior

Introduction
=
This is the Github page for Image Haze Romoval using Dark Channel Prior, which is the project of the course *Digital Image Processing (EE326)* in *Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)*. <br>
The language we use is *MATLAB* with software in version *MATLAB 2017b*.
